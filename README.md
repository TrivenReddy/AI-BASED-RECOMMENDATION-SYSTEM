##DESCRIPTION:A recommendation system is a software application that suggests products, services, or content to users based on their preferences or past interactions. These systems are widely used in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media to enhance user experience and engagement.Build a Java-based recommendation engine using Apache Mahout. Our system analyzes user-product interactions and suggests relevant products based on similar user behavior. The recommendation model is based on collaborative filtering, which finds relationships between users and items.
This project is implemented in Java using Apache Mahout for machine learning-based recommendations. The program reads a dataset (data.csv) containing user ratings for different products, processes the data, and provides personalized product recommendations for a given user..Used EclipseIDE Enterprise model for executing the project.
Maven:For managing dependencies like Apache Mahout
